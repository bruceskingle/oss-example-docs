# Example Docs
These examples demonstrate various aspects of the Symphony Allegro API. Each program is intended to show one
thing as clearly as possible with the minimum of clutter and in the clearest way possible. Each program 
is self contained and if you look at several examples you will see the same boiler plate code to deal with
command line processing and the like. This is intended to make each example readable on its own without
having to refer to utility classes or the super-class of the program to understand how it works.
